# gotmx
A ultra simple boilerplate, consisting of [Go](https://go.dev/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/).

## Dependencies
* [tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) to compile the css file with `make tw`
* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to use `make run` which hot reloads the go app on any file change (go & html)

Happy hacking
